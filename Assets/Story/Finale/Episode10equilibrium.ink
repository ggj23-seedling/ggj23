What a surprise! As a lot of living being in the entire world you have reached an equilibrium, you can't go further in your colonizing mission 
and you are strong enough to resist the assaults of the others, you may have cooperated, refused allies, fought, colonized, upgraded your spaces 
but there aren't a clear reachable goal in a near future.
+ And so?
I think that you can stop your journey, I'm satisfied, let's try again! #pause
